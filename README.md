## Locus Mons

This could use some improvement, but I think it's pretty accurate. I gotta double check on the last buildup, but I'm pretty sure it is 16. I need to figure out how to break that down into 4 reps of 4 or something.

    - Chords/Root Notes: ((Bm Bm G F#m) (Bm Bm D C#m))x2

    - Drums in 6/4 I believe

    - Drums switch to 4/4
5. Intro v1 x2 (16 measures)
6. Intro no hi-hat x2 (16 measures)
7. Intro no high guitar harmony x2 (16 measures)
    - Bass line goes down instead of up
